description: "Mines this session's transcript for durable learnings with three parallel review subagents and routes each to a concrete edit on an existing skill, applied only after the user approves. Use for /agent-skills:reflect, when the user says reflect, at the end of a session that hit corrections or friction worth keeping, or when jstack-mode's playbook step calls for it."

# Reflect

Mine the current conversation for durable learnings, then route them into skill edits.

Invoke when the user says "reflect" or "/agent-skills:reflect". Skip when the conversation is trivial, off-topic, or already covered by an existing skill the parent followed correctly. One-offs are not learnings.

## 1. Locate the active transcript

Before fanning out, find this conversation's transcript. Claude Code writes it to `~/.claude/projects/<project>/<session-id>.jsonl`, and this session's id pins the glob to it.

```bash
ls ~/.claude/projects/*/${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}.jsonl ~/.claude/projects/*/${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}/subagents/*.jsonl 2>/dev/null
```

The first path is the conversation. The rest are its subagents' transcripts, worth passing only when a finding turns on what a subagent did. Do not list or read other files under `~/.claude/projects/`. They are private chats from unrelated projects. If nothing matches, pass a tight digest of the session instead.

## 2. Spawn three reviewers in parallel

One message, three Agent calls, `subagent_type: "agent-skills:jstack-reader"`. It cannot edit files but keeps MCP access, which reviewers need to look up the tickets, chat threads, and observability traces the transcript references.

Each reviewer and the synthesizer name a role line in `~/.claude/rules/jstack-models.md` and a default. Set `model` to that line's value, or to the default if the rule or the line is missing. Leave `model` unset when the value is `inherit`. If the Agent tool rejects a value, use the default and say so.

| Lens | Role line | Default `model` | Prompt template |
|---|---|---|---|
| Judgment | `reflect judgment, divergent, synthesizer` | `opus` | `references/judgment-reviewer.md` |
| Tooling | `reflect tooling` | `fable` | `references/tooling-reviewer.md` |
| Divergent | `reflect judgment, divergent, synthesizer` | `opus` | `references/divergent-reviewer.md` |

The Tooling reviewer is the Fable second opinion, on a different tier from the other two so the panel does not share one model's blind spots. Fable and Opus are both Claude models, so the panel differs by tier, not by model family, until a non-Claude reviewer is added.

Pass each template verbatim, substituting the transcript path or digest where marked. Reviewers return findings in the Agent result.

## 3. Synthesize

One Agent call, `subagent_type: "agent-skills:jstack-reader"`, `model` from the `reflect judgment, divergent, synthesizer` line (default `opus`). It spot-verifies citations through MCP, which the reader keeps. Pass `references/synthesizer.md` verbatim, with each reviewer's full output inlined where marked. It returns an Accepted / Rejected / Backlog list.

## 4. Structural enforcement check

Move any Accepted item that a lint rule, script, metadata flag, or runtime check would enforce more reliably to Backlog. See the **encode-lessons-in-structure** principle (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/jstack-mode/principles/encode-lessons-in-structure.md`).

## 5. Apply

Present the synthesizer's full Accepted / Rejected / Backlog output and wait for explicit approval before applying any Accepted edit. The user picks the subset and may redirect routings. Skill changes affect every future agent in the org. Do not auto-apply.

File each Backlog item to your team's devex or backlog tracker without waiting. Only the Accepted list waits for approval.

Follow each approved row's Routing exactly:

- Trivial existing-skill edit (a one-line bullet, a tightened sentence, a stale fact corrected): the parent does it directly.
- Substantive existing-skill edit (a new section, a new pattern table, more than ~10 lines): hand to the **writing-for-agents** skill from mattpocock-skills when it is installed and run its loop. Otherwise follow jstack-mode's Authoring playbook (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/jstack-mode/playbooks/authoring-a-skill.md`) directly.
- `tune description: <skill path>` (the skill exists but didn't trigger when it should have): rewrite the description the same way, through **writing-for-agents** or the Authoring playbook.
- `new skill: <kebab-name>`: hand creation to **writing-for-agents** or the Authoring playbook. Do not invent the shape ad hoc.

If your environment ships a SKILL.md validator, run it on every touched skill before declaring done.

## 6. Summarize for the user

Short list, no preamble:

- Edits applied: `<skill path>`. What changed, one line each.
- New skills created: `<skill path>`. One line each (rare).
- Backlog filed to the devex tracker: `<issue title>` (`<tags>`). One line each.
- Dropped: one line per rejected finding + reason from the synthesizer.
